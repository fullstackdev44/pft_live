<p>This Project Fitness TV (PFTV) Privacy Notice applies to your use of <a href="http://www.projectfitnesstv.com">www.projectfitnesstv.com</a> , and any
other websites, applications, or services provided, owned, or operated by Project Fitness TV LLC, (with
its affiliates, “PFTV”) that link to this Privacy Notice (collectively, the “PFTV Services”). PFTV values

broadcast channel. Given the social nature of some of the PFTV Services, that information may be
collected, used, or disclosed by others who are part of that social interaction. In addition, some features of
the PFTV Services are designed to provide others with information about user activity, such as identifying
the user who created a particular Clip or the subscription status of users for a given channel. We
encourage you to be mindful of this when considering your activity on the PFTV Services.

<h2>Account Closure & Deletion</h2>

<p>If you would like to close your account and delete your profile information on <a href="http://www.projectfitnesstv.com">www.projectfitnesstv.com</a>
go to <a href="http://www.projectfitnesstv.com">www.projectfitnesstv.com</a> and send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@projectfitnesstv.com">privacy@projectfitnesstv.com</a>. For PFTV
Services other than <a href="http://www.projectfitnesstv.com">www.projectfitnesstv.com</a> you may update or delete information tied to your account,
or close an account, by also sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@projectfitnesstv.com">privacy@projectfitnesstv.com</a>. If you close your
account, PFTV may retain certain information about you for the activities described in this Privacy
Notice, or as permitted or required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services and Websites</h2>

<p>The PFTV Services may link to third-party websites or services. The privacy practices of those third
parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these
third-party websites and services to understand their practices.</p>

<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application)
through the PFTV Services or otherwise link your PFTV account with a third-party service, you are
requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your
username, the fact that your connection originated from the PFTV Services, and other relevant usage and
diagnostic information) with such third party. We may also send information about the content you watch
or your activities on the PFTV Services to such third parties. For example, we may make information
available to app developers, game developers, and class publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of
digital goods, such as class and in-class items.</p>

<h2>Advertisers and Analytics Providers</h2>

<p>PFTV may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the PFTV Services. These service
providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the PFTV
Services. The information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be
shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the PFTV
Services.</p>

<p>PFTV may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to
target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the PFTV Services. We may share
with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in
order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to
serve relevant ads). PFTV also works with third parties to serve ads to you off PFTV’s Services. When we
do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that
advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.</p>

<p>Advertisers on PFTV, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“PFTV
Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.
They automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens. They may also use
cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.
This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of
PFTV Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies. For more information about
PFTV Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising
practices, go to our <a routerLink="/page/privacy_choices">Privacy Choices</a> page.</p>

<h2>Do Not Track</h2>

<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way
for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage
visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with
meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is
why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising
Alliance opt-out links above. However, PFTV does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT
signals.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>PFTV uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security
of your information. These measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information. However, no
security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to PFTV, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such
information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<h2>Retention of Your Information</h2>

<p>PFTV maintains data related to your usage of PFTV for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the
relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for
tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you. Once you have asked us to close your
account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or
permitted to retain by law.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE PFTV
SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, PFTV does not
knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age. If PFTV learns that personal information of
persons under 13 has been collected on or through the PFTV Services, PFTV will take appropriate steps
to delete this information.</p>

<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a PFTV Services member,
then please contact PFTV at <a href="mailto:privacy@tprojectfitnesstv.com">privacy@tprojectfitnesstv.com</a> to have that child’s account terminated and
personal information deleted.</p>

<p>For residents of the EEA, where the processing of personal information is based on consent, PFTV will
not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data
protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such
processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our
records.</p>

<h2>Merger or Sale</h2>

<p>In the event that PFTV, or some or all assets related to the PFTV Services are acquired by or merged with
a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the
right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from
users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of
diligence.</p>

<h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Information collected by PFTV may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for
instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where PFTV or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities. If we provide any information about you
to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information
adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.</p>

<h2>Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice</h2>

<p>PFTV reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for
example to reflect updates to the PFTV Services or to reflect changes in the law). Please check this
Privacy Notice periodically for those changes. Your continued use of the PFTV Services after the posting
of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.</p>

<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal
information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of
affected individuals</p>
