A JURY TRIAL. You and PFTV agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within
thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to PFTV shall be sent to Project Fitness TV LLC., Attn: Legal,

prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Nassau County, New York; that
arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS;
and that the state or federal courts in Nassau County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any
appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than
class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that
would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this
Agreement and the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States law, without giving effect
to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and PFTV will not commence against the other
a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.</p>
