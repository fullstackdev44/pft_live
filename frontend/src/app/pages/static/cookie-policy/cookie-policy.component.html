<h2>What is a Cookie?</h2>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They are widely used in
order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can
do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to
recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software
application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).</p>

<h2>What Cookies do we use?</h2>

<p>Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the PFTV Services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Essential Cookies</b> These cookies are essential to the operation of the PFTV Services in order to
enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for,
such as accessing secure areas of the website or paid for content, cannot be provided. These cookies are
essential for using the website and therefore cannot be turned off without severely affecting your use of
the website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Functionality Cookies</b> In some circumstances, we may use functionality cookies. Functionality
cookies allow us to remember the choices you make on the PFTV Services and to provide enhanced and
more personalized features, such as customizing a certain webpage, remembering if we have asked you to
participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a
blog. All of these features help us to improve your visit to the PFTV Service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Targeting or Advertising Cookies</b> We and our service providers may use targeting or advertising
cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may
use targeting or advertising cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our PFTV Services and to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These cookies remember
what you have looked at on the PFTV Services and we may share this information with other
organizations, such as advertisers.</p>

<p>For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can
visit <a href="http://youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="blank">youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</a> or <a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" target="blank">allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Flash Cookies</b> We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content,
such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly
known as “Flash cookies”) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and
preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different
from the one provided by your web browser. This means it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the
browser level, in the same way you would manage cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash
management tools from Adobe’s website directly. The Adobe website provides comprehensive
information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies see <a href="http://adobe.com/security/flashplayer">adobe.com/security/flashplayer</a> for further
information. Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for the PFTV Service, you may
not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.</p>

<h2>How do third parties use cookies on the site?</h2>

<p>In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide services on the PFTV Service. For
example, developers of Extensions that are used by broadcasters on their PFTV channels may set cookies
to operate those Extensions and remember your user settings and preferences, e.g., format, position, etc.,
of the Extension.</p>

<p>In addition, third-party advertisers and other organizations may use their own cookies to collect
information about your activities on the PFTV Services websites and/or the advertisements you have
clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve advertisements that they believe are most
likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed. Third-party advertisers may also use this
information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.</p>

<p>We do not control these cookies. To disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third
party’s website. For Extensions in particular, we encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail pages to
review any privacy policy posted by the relevant developer, which may include additional information on
their cookie practices. You can also learn more about controlling cookies in the “How do I control
Cookies” section below.</p>

cookies from the PFTV Services or Extension developers using Adobe’s Flash management tools at http://
