<h1>PFTV Hateful Conduct and Harassment</h1>

<p>PFTV is a space for people to create, join, and participate in communities that share their interests. We
want everyone to be able to express themselves on PFTV, but it’s important that we do so in ways that
allow everyone to flourish. This means preventing, protecting users from, and moderating hateful
behavior and harassment.</p>

<p>We support PFTV users who express diverse or unpopular points of view, or do so in humorous or
controversial ways, but make your intent clear. We don’t tolerate conduct that encourages or condones
hate or harassment in any way. Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse for conduct that results in hate or
harassment.</p>

<p>We understand that there are many ways in which behavior might be interpreted as hateful or harassing.
When reviewing reported content or activity, we will consider its intent and context. To provide more
clarity around the these policies and how we handle such conduct, we’ve provided additional details to
complement our Community Guidelines in the sections below.</p>

<h2>Communities Responsible for Hateful Conduct and Harassment</h2>

<p>Creators are role models and leaders of the communities they create or foster around them. Creators
should consider the consequences of their statements and actions of their audiences; we ask that you make
a good faith effort to quell any efforts from those in your community to harass others.</p>

<p>PFTV should not be used to incite, encourage, promote, facilitate, or organize hateful conduct or
harassment, whether on or off PFTV. We will suspend communities, organizations, and individuals that do
so.</p>

<h2>Hateful Conduct and Harassment In-Person or Off- PFTV</h2>

<p>The PFTV community is also at conventions, PFTV Community Meetups, and even social media. Our
community encompasses all of these spaces and we take them into consideration when it comes to our
role in keeping the community safe. We may take action against persons for hateful conduct or
harassment that occurs off PFTV services that is directed at PFTV users.</p>

<h2>Additional Restrictions</h2>

<p>If examples of hateful conduct or harassment are shared in an educational context, such as news reporting
or a documentary, or raising awareness about the ways in which such conduct is bad, we ask that you
express your intent clearly and mark such content as mature.</p>

<h2>How to Report and Manage Hate and Harassment on PFTV</h2>

gesture, or behavior is unwelcome, please consider the following options:</p>

<h2>Escalating Serious Misconduct</h2>

seek help from an attorney or your local law enforcement. Specific physical threats should be reported to
your local law enforcement immediately.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<b>Do I need to be the target of a hateful comment or harassment to report a user?</b>

<p>
  <i>
    No. Sometimes an individual target of this behavior may not be aware of the harassment at the time it
takes place or may be unable to submit a report. Sometimes hateful comments may not be directed at any
one person, but rather at groups of people. Regardless of your level of involvement, hateful conduct and
harassment in violation of our Community Guidelines can be reported if observed taking place.

<b>Do I have to have to communicate a behavior is undesired for it to be considered harassment and
report the user?</b>

<p>
  <i>
    No, however in some contexts, content or activity that appears to be harassing may be unintentional and,
upon being told their actions are making others uncomfortable, the user may correct their behavior. You
may also decide that some forms of harassment are severe enough to warrant reporting without first
communicating they are unwanted. If you feel it is safe and appropriate to do so, we recommend you
clearly communicate the conduct is unwanted. If the unwanted behavior persists, we recommend you
report the user and consider other options to manage the situation such as blocking the user’s account(s)
or banning them from chat.
